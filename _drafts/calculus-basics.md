Recently, a discussion with a friend made me realize that a lot of students are
taught calculus as a bunch of formulae and not as a useful concept to understand
several phenomena in the universe. To show the beauty of calculus, I decided to
write a small tutorial explaining the basic concepts of limits, differentiation
and integration. Immediately connecting these concepts, I will also show how
basic motion laws in physics can be interpreted.

## Slope

We will be using one and only one curve the whole tutorial, it will change its
purpose and meaning as we go by. But the curve will remain the same and between
the exact same points `P1 = (x1,y1)` and `P2 = (x2,y2)`.
