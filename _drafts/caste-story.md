title: Draft story on caste set in IIT
---

two friends - meet at intro in IIT - one is a General category and the other is ST. The major story line is that they try to tackle
the problem the reservation system poses on individuls. However, the crowd get the message wrong. Their movements start getting separated
without intentions. One crowd assumes that the examination/grading system is unfair if everyone is graded the same, when people are taken in with different expectations. The other crowd assumes that the reservation system is bad. The dialogues get ugly and unrest is upon the campus. I am the general category guy and the author. It will be a second person narrative. 

There are a lot thought experiments that come out as either the ST guy or the GC guy. Some of them :

-> When people are put in new environments, the circles form and become stable pretty quickly. For some reason people feel they are 
so good friends, even though the arrangement in the intro hall is completely random. This is so ingrained in nature that it has led 
as far as forming countries more or less centuries ago.

->Segregation is a natural way to humans. Especially in India, where we need segregation to carry out our values and traditions. We want item songs/such traditions - but the ones making them are not welcome in our social circles. We want cleaners/cheap workers, that has to be the norm - but that is what causes the separation.

-> Non targeted solutions. Almost all solutions created to solve some group's problems always end up solving not the group that really requires it. Feministic rules - actually suppressed women. Reservation - actual people facing serious issues. 

-> A leader of a movement, has to be one that belongs to the group that has a problem but also being detached or uninfluenced from the problem. This makes him a leader because he is essentially different, but also one of them.

My first blog post using a `Markdown` language and `Jekyll` builder hosted freely on *Github*. It will take a while for me to get used to this. However, this is by far the simplest blogging means I have seen with by simply using `vim` and `git` on a linux shell.

This blog space will be a scratch book for my thoughts that can be out in the open.

  With all the blabbering done on this particular <b>leap day</b>, I officially restart my blogging activities.

`Jekyll` is also convenient for demonstrating code, with beautiful formatting.

```cpp
using namespace std;
int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
    cout<<"Hello World"<<endl;
    return 0;
}
```
