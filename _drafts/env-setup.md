C++ is an amazing programming language and the recent updates in STL with C++11
& C++14 make it even more handy. However, there are a lot of programmers
interested in using C++ that end up losing interest due to lack of a decent setup
for small programs. In this post, I am going to provide a very simple yet stable
development process that provides a way to create portable applications easily. 

> We will be using a combination of cmake, gcc, a bunch of common libraries, CUDA & git
