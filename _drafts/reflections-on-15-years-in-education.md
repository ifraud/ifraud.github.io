Reflections on 15 years in education
====================================

I have been extremely anxious three times in the past 15 years, related to
education. The two first events shaped my personality and the third one gave me a
PhD in Computer Science. The three events in chronological order are :

<div class="message">
My meeting with a teacher/administrator named Madhavi. I had been skipping class
notes for all subjects and she received a complaint from my mother about it.
Madhavi asked me to wait outside her office. 
</div>

<div class="message">
My meeting with an associate professor at IIT-D named Dr. Brijesh Lal. We decided
to change our supervisor for our B.Tech Project due to a fall out with Dr. Mona
Mathur and Dr. Santanu Chaudhury. B.Lal asked us to wait outside his office.
</div>

<div class="message">
My meeting with two opponents, Dr. Wei Tsang Ooi from NUS and Dr. Judith Alice
Redi from TU Delft. One of them in person in Oslo and one online half way across
the world in Singapore, about to commence the defence process of my PhD. The
committee asked us to wait outside the auditorium.
</div>

Finally, I decided to write up on events that had a significant impact on me and
my personality during my education.
 This will be done by expanding on the three events described above.
This account might be disturbingly entertaining. However, it is definitely worth
sharing atleast to the different young minds that might be standing right
outside some
 doors being anxious about their future and the definite doom that they
believe that is upon them, simply because they do not fit into the norm.

Physical abuse as a tool for education
--------------------------------------
I am completely unaware if I have a problem in writing with my hand, 
 I did not get my time to figure this out. But needless to say, I hated it! I
still cannot write a piece of text properly. I have no issues in typing on a
keyboard and I personally prefer doing that. Anyways, moving to the main topic.
 In a completely crappy school,
called Keshava Reddy Public School where
I unfortunately had to learn my fundamentals in science and mathematics, a
serious group of largely under-qualified teachers assumed that physical abuse is
the only road to Education, Discipline and Decency.

Their method of teaching involved largely dictating notes to students where the
students are supposed to take it down as it was disctated. This notes included
all possible questions that could end up in the exam. Then, an examination is
conducted where a subset of questions from the notes are asked, to which the
only correct answers were the ones in the notes - word-to-word. The textbooks
had a wealth of knowledge that was irrelevant as long as these *right answers*
were repeated. As a result, students scored 100 % in each of the subjects without
understanding the beauty of a circle, the mystery of a prism, the brilliance of
Arthur Conan Doyle or the intricacies of the Opium war. Yet the students
excelled with these topics as their syllabus for several classes to later follow
the same trend. 

I had troubles with all of this! I whined! I complained! Yet nobody listened!
Why should anybody listen to a 12 year old with a twisted mind! The school was on a
trajectory to 
becoming very successful, scoring the highest possible percentages in all subjects
in the state of Andhra Pradesh. There was a point, where they thought I might
have some mental problems. Their obvious solution to setting me straight was
physical abuse. Except for one teacher, every single one that took a class of
mine laid hands/canes on me. 

I never wrote my class notes, they were all empty books. I read from the text
books and other's notes, attempted the questions *the proper way*. At one particular time, Madhavi
even crossed out my entire answer sheets saying that my answers were not the
ones from the class notes, even though a senior lecturer approved of them!
Obviously, this sort of interaction did not earn me many friends at the time.
 However, my empty books was an open secret to many of the students largely
because I borrowed some notes from other students at times. At one particular
time, one of the girls in my class decided to ask me for notes right infront of
my mom. I tried to send her off causing suspicions in my mom's head. Naturally,
she discovered my guilt, it was simply flipping a couple of empty book pages.
This was reported to the school immediately, mostly because they paid a lot of
money to the school.

The next day, I went to school and waited at that door. My mind got clouded with
 thoughts hinting me that I made the biggest mistake a student could ever make and
that this is the end of my education.
