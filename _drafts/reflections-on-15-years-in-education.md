title: From a bad student to a PhD 
---

My lack of compliance to authorities and beliefs had put me in some cases in a bad
spot. Originally I thought that my backward hometown and the people there had suffered
from being too gullible & ignorant - however lately I am realizing that actually 
most people in the world are affected by it.

Coming straight to the point: accepting bull-shit has never been my strength.
In the current day, this is seen by many as an unwanted annoyance, undeserved arrogance, or
just a weird charm. But this was not always the case.

Reflections on 15 years in education
====================================

I have been extremely anxious three times in the past 15 years, related to
education. The two first events shaped my personality and the third one gave me a
PhD in Computer Science. The three events in chronological order are :

<div class="message">
My meeting with a teacher/administrator named Madhavi. I had been skipping class
notes for all subjects and she received a complaint from my mother about it.
Madhavi asked me to wait outside her office. 
</div>

<div class="message">
My meeting with an associate professor at IIT-D named Dr. Brijesh Lal. We decided
to change our supervisor for our B.Tech Project due to a fall out with Dr. Mona
Mathur and Dr. Santanu Chaudhury. B.Lal asked us to wait outside his office.
</div>

<div class="message">
My meeting with two opponents, Dr. Wei Tsang Ooi from NUS and Dr. Judith Alice
Redi from TU Delft. One of them in person in Oslo and one online half way across
the world in Singapore, about to commence the defence process of my PhD. The
committee asked us to wait outside the auditorium.
</div>

Finally, I decided to write up on events that had a significant impact on me and
my personality during my education.
 This will be done by expanding on the three events described above.
This account might be disturbingly entertaining. However, it is definitely worth
sharing atleast to the different young minds that might be standing right
outside some
 doors being anxious about their future and the definite doom that they
believe that is upon them, simply because they do not fit into the norm.

> PS: None of this is fiction and all the names here are provided on purpose! Also this is not a rant about the education system in India, there are millions of such rants. Honestly I think all education systems suck - they are tailored to be one-fit-for-all systems - but not all students are the same.


Physical abuse as a tool for education
--------------------------------------
I am completely unaware if I have a problem in writing with my hand, 
 I did not get my time to figure this out. But needless to say, I hated it! I
still cannot write a piece of text properly. I have no issues in typing on a
keyboard and I personally prefer doing that much like
[this](http://theoatmeal.com/blog/handwriting). Anyways, moving to the main topic.
 In a completely crappy school,
called Keshava Reddy Public School, where
I unfortunately had to learn my fundamentals in science, mathematics, and everything, a
group of seriously under-qualified teachers assumed that physical abuse is
the only road to *Education, Discipline and Decency*.

Their method of teaching involved largely dictating notes to students where the
students are supposed to take it down as it was dictated. This notes included
all possible questions that could end up in the exam, along with their answers. Then, an examination is
conducted where a subset of questions from the notes are asked, to which the
only correct answers were the ones in the notes - word-to-word. The textbooks
had a wealth of knowledge that was irrelevant as long as these *right answers*
were repeated. As a result, students scored 100 % in each of the subjects without
understanding the beauty of a circle, the mystery of a prism, the brilliance of
Arthur Conan Doyle or the intricacies of the Opium war. Yet the students
excelled with these topics as their syllabus for several classes to later follow
the same trend. Needless to say, this formula was immensely popular even with parents
paying a blind eye - because students scored very high marks in examinations.
 Obviously, the knowledge and perception of the parents in that 
town was also of arguable quality - they were just plain ignorant - including mine until
 much later.

I had troubles with all of this! I whined! I complained! Yet very few listened, and nobody acted!
Why should anybody listen to a 12 year old with a twisted mind! The school was on a
trajectory to 
becoming very successful, scoring the highest possible percentages in all subjects
in the state of Andhra Pradesh. There was a point, where they even thought I might
have a few mental problems. Their obvious solution to setting me straight was
physical abuse. Except for one teacher, every single one that took a class of
mine had laid hands/canes on me. 

I never wrote my class notes, they were all empty books. I read from the text
books and other's notes, attempted the questions *the improper way*. At one particular time, Madhavi
 (the vice principal) even crossed out my entire answer sheets saying that my answers were not the
ones from the class notes, even though a senior lecturer approved of them!
Obviously, this sort of interaction did not earn me many friends at the time.
 However, my empty books were open secret to many of the students largely
because I borrowed some notes from other students at times. At one particular
time, one of the girls in my class decided to ask me for notes right infront of
my mom. I tried to send her off causing suspicions in my mom's head.
She discovered my guilt, it was simply flipping a couple of empty book pages.
This was reported to the school immediately, mostly because they paid a lot of
[money to the
school](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/keshava-reddy-deposit-fraud-close-to-rs-700-cr-says-cid/article7839493.ece).

The next day, I went to school and waited at that door. My mind got clouded with
 thoughts hinting me that I made the biggest mistake a student could ever make and
that this is the end of my education. This was how I was made to feel.
 Well! Nothing happened, I was forced to
write most of my notes by kneeling infront of her office for a couple of days.
To be honest, that was not even close to the worst of my imaginations. 
Naturally, this sort of episodes caused me to question authority a lot more than
most people and not bother about what people thought of me.
 
This continued for a couple of years until the board exams for tenth class.
After that, my patience broke and informed my parents that I shall only continue my
education at some other much bigger place outside of the town. 

With an insatiable zeal for knowledge especially in mathematics & physics, the
two final years of my high school is where I learnt the most and formed all my
basics. I did not care about the poor background earlier, I just went on to
learn whatever I could find. I joined a boarding school for those years.
 These two years were the worst days in terms of life.
 We were shoved into rooms in groups of 12 with barely enough space to fit 3. The food
was horrible, sometimes we even found insects in there. However, I loved those days because of the opportunities there.
 This period, along with availability of high
quality material and good teachers, paved way into IIT-Delhi, arguably the best
engineering school in India, for my Bachelors education.

With great power comes free labour and unquestioned authority.
------------------------------------------

My bachelors is where I grew up as a person. By the time I got to IITD - I was
still an unrest young mind only having had 2 years of proper schooling by far.
Obviously my social skills were a complete mess - they still are according to
many standards, but my friends are patient. At IITD, you find mostly smart
people handpicked from all over India. And most of them have had been the best
in their schools and had an amazing confidence level. I was rather fascinated by
these people. But I still kept my distance from any group of people. Most of my
interactions were individual. This changed across the 4 years of Bachelors
period where I finally considered myself a part of a group of very good friends.
