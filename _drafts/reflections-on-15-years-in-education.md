title: Reflections on 15 years in education, from a bad student to a PhD.
---

I have been extremely anxious three times in the past 15 years, related to
education. The two first events shaped my personality and the third one gave me a
PhD in Computer Science. The three events in chronological order :

My meeting with a teacher/administrator named Madhavi. I had been skipping class
notes for all subjects and she received a complaint from my mother about it.
Madhavi asked me to wait outside her office.

My meeting with an associate professor at IIT-D named Dr. Brijesh Lal. We decided
to change our supervisor for our B.Tech Project due to a fall out with Dr. Mona
Mathur and Dr. Santanu Chaudhury. B.Lal asked us to wait outside his office.

My meeting with two opponents, Dr. Wei Tsang Ooi from NUS and Dr. Judith Alice
Redi from TU Delft. One of them in person in Oslo and one online half way across
the world in singapore, about to commence the defence process of my PhD. The
committee asked us to wait outside the auditorium.
