Reflections on 15 years in education
====================================

I have been extremely anxious three times in the past 15 years, related to
education. The two first events shaped my personality and the third one gave me a
PhD in Computer Science. The three events in chronological order are :

<div class="message">
My meeting with a teacher/administrator named Madhavi. I had been skipping class
notes for all subjects and she received a complaint from my mother about it.
Madhavi asked me to wait outside her office. 
</div>

<div class="message">
My meeting with an associate professor at IIT-D named Dr. Brijesh Lal. We decided
to change our supervisor for our B.Tech Project due to a fall out with Dr. Mona
Mathur and Dr. Santanu Chaudhury. B.Lal asked us to wait outside his office.
</div>

<div class="message">
My meeting with two opponents, Dr. Wei Tsang Ooi from NUS and Dr. Judith Alice
Redi from TU Delft. One of them in person in Oslo and one online half way across
the world in Singapore, about to commence the defence process of my PhD. The
committee asked us to wait outside the auditorium.
</div>

Finally, I decided to write up on events that had a significant impact on me and
my personality during my education.
 This will be done by expanding on the three events described above.
This account might be disturbingly entertaining. However, it is definitely worth
sharing atleast to the different young minds that might be standing right
outside some
 doors being anxious about their future and the definite doom that they
believe that is upon them, simply because they do not fit into the norm.

Physical abuse as a tool for education
--------------------------------------
I am completely unaware if I have a problem in writing with my hand, 
 I did not get my time to figure this out. But needless to say, I hated it! I
still cannot write a piece of text properly. I have no issues in typing on a
keyboard and I personally prefer doing that. Anyways, moving to the main topic.
 In a completely crappy school,
called Keshava Reddy Public School where
I unfortunately had to learn my fundamentals in science and mathematics, a
serious group of largely under-qualified teachers assumed that physical abuse is
the only road to Education, Discipline and Decency.

Their method of teaching involved largely dictating notes to students where the
students are supposed to take it down as it was disctated. This notes included
all possible questions that could end up in the exam. Then, an examination is
conducted where a subset of questions from the notes are asked, to which the
only correct answers were the ones in the notes - word-to-word. The textbooks
had a wealth of knowledge that was irrelevant as long as these *right answers*
were repeated.
