title: Can all humans pass the Turing test?
---

Alan Turing proposed a phenomenal way to test intelligence on machines. In
simple words, Turing test can be summarized as:
<div class = "message">
If the human being conducting the test is unable to consistently determine
 whether an answer has been given by a computer or by another human being,
 then the computer is considered to have <b>passed</b> the test. 
</div>

This is a very beautiful abstraction of a way to see whether a machine is capable 
to be intelligent on par with humans.

There are lot of works and many philosophical thoughts on Turing test which question
the validity of this abstraction. Most of them revolve around the 'nature of intelligence'.
However, my recent thoughts revolved a bit around the problems with humans that
 invalidate the test. The main question that I started my thought experiment with is

> Can all humans pass the Turing test?

Needless to say, the answer to this question is yes with some exceptions - except that 
the number of exceptions is in the order of billions. So, the answer is an affirmative 'No'.
 Now, when a human fails at a Turing test, do we say that the sample is a bad one or do we 
question the validity of the test. Many philosophical discussion on Turing test focus a lot
 on the validity of the 'intelligence'. On the other hand, my thoughts concluded that
 rather the link between the judge and the subjects as a weak one, because there is no absolute
 'intelligence'.
