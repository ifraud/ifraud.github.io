My first blog post using a `Markdown` and `Jekyll` builder hosted freely on *Github*. It will take a while for me to get used to this. However, this is by far the simplest blogging means I have seen with by simply using `vim` and `git` on a linux shell.

This blog space will be a scratch book for my thoughts that can be out in the open.

  With all the blabbering done on this particular leap day**, I officially restart my blogging activities.

`Jekyll` is also convenient for demonstrating code, with beautiful formatting.

```python
s = "Hotel California"
print s
```
