title: Introduction

My first blog post using a `Markdown` language and `Jekyll` builder hosted freely on *Github*. It will take a while for me to get used to this. However, this is by far the simplest blogging means I have seen with by simply using `vim` and `git` on a linux shell.

This blog space will be a scratch book for my thoughts that can be out in the open.

  With all the blabbering done on this particular <b>leap day</b>, I officially restart my blogging activities.

`Jekyll` is also convenient for demonstrating code, with beautiful formatting.

```cpp
using namespace std;
int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
    cout<<"Hello World"<<endl;
    return 0;
}
```
