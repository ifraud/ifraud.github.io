Easily one of the best books I read recently, `The hunt for vulcan` by Thomas
Levenson depicts an amazing story in the history of science. The book is about a
hypothetical planet named **vulcan** that is probably one of the best examples of
 *confirmation bias*. 

The story starts with Newton's gravitational theory, that took the world by
surprise, explaining everything from an apple's trajectory to the orbit of mars around
the sun. The theory kept mathematicians and astronomers busy for a couple of
centuries to predict and verify the trajectories of various bodies visible both in day &
night sky. 

A french mathematician *Le verrier* came under spotlight when, using the
gravitational theory and a pen, figured out the existence & precise position of
*Neptune* - arguably the farthest planet in the solar system. He came up with that in
an attempt to explain the behavior of the-then farthest planet *Uranus*. In an
attempt to have a complete explanation of solar system, his focus turned to
*Mercury* - the-then closest planet to the sun in the solar system.

In a similar attempt to explain mercury's observed trajectory, Le verrier
proposed the existence of a new planet `vulcan` between sun & mercury. For a
little under a century, astronomers ventured to utilize the short windows of
total solar eclipses with the single aim to see the phantom planet. Some very famous
astronomers even took the thought, that they saw vulcan, to their graves.

Then comes along a young clerk in a patent office using his exceptional
imagination abilities. His theories changed the world. But in the context of the
book, he destroyed vulcan. His theory of general relativity provided a
convincing explanation of why mercury acted that way.

In summary, the book is a fascinating tale of how Le verrier created the
farthest planet in the solar system using the pen and Einstein destroyed the
supposedly-closest one to the sun using a pen too!
