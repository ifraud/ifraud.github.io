After a recommendation from a friend, I picked this book almost immediately.
Let me be clear with the fact that this is not an easy read. It is packed with
information that gets more & more speculative as the chapters pass by.  And set
aside atleast a couple of months to read and admire its entirety. Needless to
say, there is a lot of **homework** that can help in understanding the intricacies
of the book.

The book opens with a promise to explore one of the very possible ways that
life came to existence. That is exactly what the book delivers indeed. The
author takes on a wild journey all the way down to the cell level and starts
speculating how such mysterious building blocks of pretty much all life could
have *born* out of materials that existed a couple of billion years ago on earth.  

I am very impressed by the way the author explains proton gradient as the fundamental 
driving element of life. Then he ventures on a very impressive journey to explain the origins of
 *prokaryotes* - leading to even the possible seperation of archea & bacteria. This part of the book is
 well written and definitely is the highlight of the entire book. 

Then he continues to speculate about the possible evolution of *eukaryotes*. It
gets very speculative and monotonous by this point. This part of the book is
nice, but it did not excite me at the same level as the prokaryotes section
did. Nevertheless, the discussion on energy being one of the fundamental driving forces is very intriguing. 

The book sets out vast amounts of material & opinions for very interesting
thoughts. It is very engaging in the way it is written. However, the author's
sense of humor is definitely not on par with his intellectual!
