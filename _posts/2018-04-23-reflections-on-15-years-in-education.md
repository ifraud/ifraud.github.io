title: From a bad student to a PhD 
---

My lack of compliance to authorities and beliefs had put me in some cases in a bad
spot. Originally I thought that my backward hometown and the people there had suffered
from being too gullible & ignorant - however lately I am realizing that actually 
most people in the world are affected by it.

Coming straight to the point: accepting bull-shit has never been my strength.
In the current day, this is seen by many as an unwanted annoyance, undeserved arrogance, or
just a weird charm. But this was not always the case.

Reflections on 15 years in education
====================================

I have been extremely anxious three times in the past 15 years, related to
education. The two first events shaped my personality and the third one gave me a
PhD in Computer Science. The three events in chronological order are :

<div class="message">
My meeting with a teacher/administrator named Madhavi. I had been skipping class
notes for all subjects and she received a complaint from my mother about it.
Madhavi asked me to wait outside her office. 
</div>

<div class="message">
My meeting with an associate professor at IIT-D named Dr. Brijesh Lal. We decided
to change our supervisor for our B.Tech Project due to a fall out with Dr. Mona
Mathur and Dr. Santanu Chaudhury. B.Lal asked us to wait outside his office.
</div>

<div class="message">
My meeting with two opponents, Dr. Wei Tsang Ooi from NUS and Dr. Judith Alice
Redi from TU Delft. One of them in person in Oslo and one online half way across
the world in Singapore, about to commence the defence process of my PhD. The
committee asked us to wait outside the auditorium.
</div>

Finally, I decided to write up on events that had a significant impact on me and
my personality during my education.
 This will be done by expanding on the three events described above.
This account might be disturbingly entertaining. However, it is definitely worth
sharing atleast to the different young minds that might be standing right
outside some
 doors being anxious about their future and the definite doom that they
believe that is upon them, simply because they do not fit into the norm.

> PS: None of this is fiction and all the names here are provided on purpose - Let them all get a credit, good or bad! Also this is not a rant about the education system in India, there are millions of such rants. Honestly I think all education systems suck - they are tailored to be one-fit-for-all systems - but not all students are the same. This is more about mindsets of different people that handle kids at very important ages that lead them to fully grown adults.


Physical abuse as a tool for education
--------------------------------------
I am completely unaware if I have a problem in writing with my hand, 
 I did not get my time to figure this out. But needless to say, I hated it! I
still cannot write a piece of text properly. I have no issues in typing on a
keyboard and I personally prefer doing that, much like
[this](http://theoatmeal.com/blog/handwriting). Anyways, moving on to the main topic.
 In a completely crappy school,
called Keshava Reddy Public School, where
I unfortunately had to learn my fundamentals in science, mathematics, and everything, a
group of seriously under-qualified teachers assumed that physical abuse is
the only road to *Education, Discipline and Decency*.

Their method of teaching involved largely dictating notes to students where the
students are supposed to take it down as it was dictated. This notes included
all possible questions that could end up in the exam, along with their answers. Then, an examination is
conducted where a subset of questions from the notes are asked, to which the
only correct answers were the ones in the notes - word-to-word. The textbooks
had a wealth of knowledge that was irrelevant as long as these *right answers*
were repeated. As a result, students scored 100 % in each of the subjects without
understanding the beauty of a circle, the mystery of a prism, the brilliance of
Arthur Conan Doyle or the intricacies of the Opium war. Yet the students
excelled with these topics as their syllabus for several classes to later follow
the same trend. Needless to say, this formula was immensely popular even with parents
paying a blind eye - because students scored very high marks in examinations.
 Obviously, the knowledge and perception of the parents in that 
town was also of arguable quality - they were just plain ignorant - including mine until
 much later.

I had troubles with all of this! I whined! I complained! Yet very few listened, and nobody acted!
Why should anybody listen to a 12 year old with a twisted mind! The school was on a
trajectory to 
becoming very successful, scoring the highest possible percentages in all subjects
in the state of Andhra Pradesh. There was a point, where they even thought I might
have a few mental problems. Their obvious solution to setting me straight was
physical abuse. Except for one teacher, every single one that took a class of
mine had laid hands/canes on me.

I never wrote my class notes, they were all empty books. I read from the text
books and other's notes, attempted the questions *the improper way*. At one particular time, Madhavi
 (the vice principal) even crossed out my entire answer sheets saying that my answers were not the
ones from the class notes, even though a senior lecturer approved of them!
Obviously, this sort of interaction did not earn me many friends at the time.
 However, my empty books were open secret to many of the students largely
because I borrowed some notes from other students at times. At one particular
time, one of the girls in my class decided to ask me for notes right infront of
my mom. I tried to send her off causing suspicions in my mom's head.
She discovered my guilt, it was simply flipping a couple of empty book pages.
This was reported to the school immediately, mostly because they paid a lot of
[money to the
school](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/keshava-reddy-deposit-fraud-close-to-rs-700-cr-says-cid/article7839493.ece).

The next day, I went to school and waited at that door. My mind got clouded with
 thoughts hinting me that I made the biggest mistake a student could ever make and
that this is the end of my education. This was how I was made to feel.
 Well! Nothing happened, I was forced to
write most of my notes by kneeling infront of her office for a couple of days.
To be honest, that was not even close to the worst of my imaginations. 
Naturally, this sort of episodes caused me to question authority a lot more than
most people and not bother about what people thought of me.
 
This continued for a couple of years until the board exams for tenth class.
After that, my patience broke and informed my parents that I shall only continue my
education at some other much bigger place outside of the town. 

With an insatiable zeal for knowledge especially in mathematics & physics, the
two final years of my high school is where I learnt the most and formed all my
basics. I did not care about the poor background earlier, I just went on to
learn whatever I could find. I joined a boarding school for those years.
 These two years were the worst days in terms of life.
 We were shoved into rooms in groups of 12 with barely enough space to fit 3. The food
was horrible, sometimes we even found insects in there. However, I loved those days because of the opportunities there.
 This period, along with availability of high
quality material and good teachers, paved way into IIT-Delhi, arguably the best
engineering school in India, for my Bachelors education.

With great power comes free labour and unquestioned authority.
------------------------------------------

My bachelors was where I grew up as a person. By the time I got to IITD - I was
still an unrest young mind only having had 2 years of proper schooling by far.
Obviously my social skills were a complete mess - they still are according to
many standards, but my friends are patient. At IITD, you find mostly smart
people handpicked from all over India. And most of them have had been the best
in their schools and had an amazing confidence level. I was rather fascinated by
these people. But I still kept my distance from any group of people. Most of my
interactions were individual. This changed across the 4 years of Bachelors
period where I finally considered myself a part of a group of very good friends towards the end. 
Thanks to these awesome few, I learnt a lot about life in general - books, movies,
 music, travelling, social interactions - pretty much everything.

>Those idiots still think that it is cool that I am a changed person, without actually realizing that they were the cause for that change.

During this period, I got to learn a lot about the engineering world too -
later to learn that it was just a peek really. I was fascinated by using
machines to process data, not just crunching numbers - but actual data that we
interact with every day - sound & videos. I got in touch with Signal
Processing, in particular Image processing and then into Multimedia systems.
The ability to play with some data that we can visually observe has fascinated
me, I am still kind of doing the same and will always be fascinated by it.

So, we approached in-house Multimedia expert Dr. Santanu Chaudhury to try out a
minor project and that went quite well. We played with some video processing
algorithms on FPGA. My partner then got wary of this person and decided to go
to another professor. I should have done the same, but me being me does not
help. I managed to sweet talk another poor guy to pick up the BTech project
course which is a 10-credit work done in two parts(3 & 7). Kind of a big deal
with very little flexibility on when to do the project. So the aim is to finish
part-1 in 7th semester, then part-2 in 8th semester, enjoy the summer and
graduate with flying hats in the fall. We got in contact with Dr. Mona Mathur
and started our project on video coding. Dr. Mona Mathur is an industry person
who used to work at an esteemed company.

Things were going fine in part-1 until we reached the end. At the end of 7th
semester, in addition to most final exams - we also do our job placements.
Voila! I get an email from Dr. Mona Mathur, to refactor the code - which was
her mistake to start with as she *forgot* to give the coding standards before
we started coding, despite me asking her a couple of times. I tried to tell her
that we have a lot of exams and other things now, refactoring an already
working code before our demo session is not really at the highest of my
priorites. Looking back at it, I am still very confused at what is wrong with
saying that. It is an adult to adult conversation with a clash of opinions.
Except that is not how anything works in India, as I learnt then, even in the
most premiere institutes. It is a messy situation in IITs really, there are
several professors - who feel that there are these very sharp young minds they
can help, that just need a little wisdom and help to start conquering the
world. And then there are professors like Dr. Santanu Chaudhury.

So, we got off to a messy ground with Dr. Mona Mathur, who ended up sharing
these conversations at our presentation with the project committee.  Imagine
the need to pick on 19 year old students by being smily with us and sneaking an
attack this way. It was just a mess. So, we decided that we do not want to
continue with her and we decided to switch our supervisors. Then Dr. Santanu
Chaudhury has decided that Dr.
Brijesh Lal is going to play the good cop. So, we waited outside his office, he
took us in and explained how a messy situation this is now. And he basically
said that if we opt to switch the supervisor, we have to fail this course and
redo it. Irrespective of all the work we have done, they put us in a very
awkward situation - almost blackmailing.  Because, if we fail this course in
7th semester - there is no way that we will graduate on expected time and we
have to prolong our bachelors by another year. I said 'okay - we will take the
fail grade' because I was done with their bull-shit. Here again, I could have
given in and take another semester of torture to get our degree in time. But I
did not. Instead, we went back to Dr. Santanu Chaudhury, because he was
conveniently the associate dean of the school too. We asked him to let us do
both parts in the same semester or do part-2 in summer semester. He agreed! We
made a deal with another professor to do all the work in the 8th semester and
just do the formalities in summer. So, everything was good.

Well, except that it was not all good yet. Dr. Santanu Chaudhury,
declined us to register the course in summer semester and declined to discuss
the issue with us. So, the extension became inevitable and we had no clue what
to do. We approached the head of the department and after listening to the whole
fiasco, Dr. R. K. Patney and Dr. Visweswaran decided to help us. So, we made a
case to the director to amend the IIT-Delhi rules to accomodate us to finish
this course in summer - with pretty much the whole department supporting us
actually including Dr. Brijesh Lal. It went to the director, he approved it
and it went to the dean for registration.  Dr. Santanu Chaudhury still being
the associate dean decided to stall the work until the summer is over - this is
unfortunately a very common thing to do in Indian bureaucracy. So, we had to
get the pressure from ministry of education to let him stop his war with 2
clue-less undergrad students and do his job of graduating students
properly. When all of this was done, the department joked about having to turn
the sky up-side down to see us graduate. We laughed too then! But we did not do
well for about 7 months before that, there was a lot of stress and anxiety - to
find a job during placements. Once we got the jobs, we were not sure if we can
still keep those if we had our graduation date extended. Unfortunately, I am
responsible for all this to happen to poor Gaurav Berry, the affected teammate.
Imagine that both of us cleared the national level entrance examination which
was written by approximately 200,000 students by being in the top 200. Then we
encounter this shit-storm due to very two non-sensible people and a system that
allows such people to pursue their power until very far. When I put it that
way, it makes no sense - however we had to deal with that for over 7 months.

The sad part is that there are many poor students that are still suffering in
those institutes mostly due to very few shitty professors.
They even have a few suicides in these premiere institutes of India, the biggest
democracy in the world - because these top-minds feel opressed and that is
their only way out.

<div class="message">
For students:
When shit hits the fan due to circumstances or shitty people, do not worry -
make more noise, there are powerful people out there that do want to help you.
You just need to make enough noise to reach them.
</div>

<div class="message">
For parents:
The reason that this story is going out now is because people in India think
that all their kids are going to find in IIT is glory and fat salary packages.
Due to those pursuits, they put stress on very young kids - stop doing that,
don't be a shitty parent.
</div>

The best people in the field (or the world), they always want to help.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

After the whole fiasco, I took a year off to practice photography, explore, and
hike in various mountains in India. Then I decided to try out masters somewhere
outside of India. I ended up doing Erasmus Mundus which gave me a plenty of opportunities
to socialize and learn from people of very different origins and cultures. Then
things went on to me doing a PhD at University of Oslo with Dr. Carsten Griwodz and
Dr. Pal Halvorsen. Due to these guys, I met many top researchers and scientists in the
field of multimedia. And many of them just wanted to help me do good in my PhD. None
of them had any benefit from it. They would organize visits to various labs and
participate in long discussions with valuable input just so that I could progress.

In the process I met Dr. Klara Nahrstedt at a conference, she is a renowned scientist
and helped me arrange a visit to the CS department at UIUC(one of the best ones in the
world). Similarly, when I met Dr. Wei Tsang Ooi from NUS at a conference, I was truly inspired with his
kindness and humbleness. He is a very accomplished scientist in the field of multimedia.
Yet he speaks to you as a friend. Likewise Dr. Judith Alice Redi from TU Delft was a source of
great inspiration for me with her work at such a young age. Eventually, I was very proud and extremely
happy to have two of these three inspiring people to be on my PhD committee. My excitement was barely
contained when they agreed.

I did spend many hours at the lab, sometimes late into the night. But all of that work
was done by choice and to keep up with other researchers. I have to say that I did hate writing
the thesis quite a lot, but it was a necessary evil for the PhD. At the end of the day, none of these
top people in the field caused me any stress, on the contrary they helped me quite a bit. Without them
my PhD would not have been the same.

There are many issues with academic world, but those are being discussed all over. Infact, I
quit academic world due to the lack of a balanced life. But such issues are now
widely discussed. Moreover, I did not encounter many of those issues during my PhD to cover as anecdotes.

Concluding note.
-----------------

Looking back as a retrospective.

|     What went well!                      | What could have gone better                         |
| --------------------------------------  |-----------------------------------------------------|
| I did get a PhD in CS by the age of 28  | I should have been a less pain in the ass sometimes |
| I found my love for physics and mathematics  | I should have focussed on writing |
| The school methods are now proved to be wrong | More kids and parents should be aware of such places |

The point is that instead of teaching what mistakes are fine to make and what mistakes are bad. My school
taught us making any mistake is bad. To the point that people do not distinguish from a necessary mistake
to a horrible one. Kids learn how to walk by falling several times. Obviously teaching a kid to not fall and
 not to fall over a cliff is not the same thing - this difference is what needs to be taught - not all the rigid
bull shit about religions, cultures, traditions, and such.
