<p class="message">
  Hey there! I am Vamsidhar Reddy Gaddam or simply Vamsi.
</p>


I am currently an engineer at [ARM](http://www.arm.com/). I graduated with a *PhD
in Computer Science* from *University of Oslo*. My mind wanders among
programming, science, hiking and random thoughts about *everything* under the
sun.

Just drop me a message if you would like to have a tutorial blog post about
anything related Image processing, computer vision, graphics or parallel
programming.
