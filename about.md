<p class="message">
  Hey there! I am Vamsidhar Reddy Gaddam or simply Vamsi.
</p>


I am currently an engineer at [ARM](http://www.arm.com/). I graduated with a *PhD
in Computer Science* from *University of Oslo*. My mind wanders among
programming, science, hiking and random thoughts about *everything* under the
sun.

Just drop me a message here, if you would like to have a tutorial blog post about
anything related to Image processing, computer vision, graphics or parallel
programming. If you want to collaborate or contribute content, I would be gladly
up for it. In general, I am always up for new ideas!
